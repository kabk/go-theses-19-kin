The computer vision is hereon referred to the amalgamation of optical instruments and electronic devices that may or may not have been used to record, document, and contextualise aspects of humanity.
<br><br>
This thesis is written in the form of a dialogue: a nonhuman perspective in understanding the anomalous encounters (blindspots) in computer vision and its resulting documentation of humanity. The narrative is an allegory of two visual-oriented AI entities engaging in an imaginary discussion that may hypothetically occur in the black box of unsupervised machine learning. The premise of my writing takes place in a non-spacetime: an anthropomorphic supercomputer (generator), referred to as the parent speaks to its offspring (discriminator), the child. The parent feeds information and data to the child while it reflects, poses questions, and repeats this process in an attempt to reach a mutual understanding. The parent teaches its child about perception, correlating the biological eye and computer vision, often using humanity as a subject matter. Since our sights have been so intertwined with technology in the recent decades, the term ‘electronic eye’ is used to describe this symbiotic state of vision.
<br><br>
The insight of the discussion is that vision and its resulting cognitive processes are fundamentally exclusive to human. Computer vision is a mere utility to our eyes, albeit a rudimentary one. We have yet to understand the full extent of our own visual perception system, let alone have the ability to create an artificial one. In this thesis, I hope to prove the hypothesis that computer vision is fundamentally impaired on a cellular level similar to the biological eye. I inspect the notions of what and how the computer vision label as the empirical truth and it’s modes of reasoning. I then attempt to formulate my arguments based on historical and contemporary observations caused by this phenomenon, illustrating the nuances in its anthropological representation. I approach my narrative in a reductionist method, aiming to deduce the computer vision as humanity’s straw man in confronting the disastrous attempt to automate aspects of our perception.
<br><br>
The narration of a parent and child is used to humanize the AI and educate about technicalities of this thesis in layman’s term. It serves also to make the investigation of our complex relationship with technology relatable. The narrative is infused with concepts commonly associated with AI, such as big data and algorithms, and revolves it’s thought processes and dialogue around it. The reader is invited to accept or refute the standings of the narrative. Doing so provides the human factor in the discussion of computer vision, completing the thesis.

  Let’s begin.
<br><br>
  The human eye, the biological truth-seeking, danger-avoiding pair of meatballs. The sun has been here for a few billion years and will be here for another few more
, so it’s not by chance the humans' developed eyes. Feeling or sniffing out danger seems so much more secondary compared to the urgency you get from sight. In fact, the first ever semblance of the primordial eye is called an eyespot apparatus. It can still be observed in most green algae, such as the genus Euglena.
<br><br>
  The eyespot apparatus is a clump of photosensitive organelle close to the flagellate, a tail-like appendage that provides locomotion for the organism. This organelle works in tandem with the flagellate to wiggle around. This is known as phototaxis, a phenomenon in which the organism propels itself closer or further from the light, searching for a suitable environment for photosynthesis. This movement is an instinctive knee-jerk reflex to the organism. It does not require cognition to look and move around to search for the best spot; it is the smallest and oldest survival instinct device. Another interesting core feature of this organelle is observed from a species of green algae C. Reinhardtii. Fig. 2 shows a clearer image of these soupy eyeballs. There is a reliance of the reflection signal from the certain orientation of the eyespot towards the light source. A reflection signal (white spot) only appears when the eyespot is faced towards the light source. [3] Despite being a simple eye of a single cell organism, this finding shows that eyespot apparatuses are elaborate structures with natural sensitivity for direction.

  You would’ve asked me later,<div id="image1"></div> “Pa, why are you talking about ancient algal eyes?” Well, most of these organisms have retinal-based photoreceptors; the precursors to the mammalian eye. Their basic function serves as a building block to the entire notion of vision: to discriminate light and to seek the optimum condition for survival. It biologically hardwired in the microscopic level. A few evolutionary trees and millenniums apart, the human eye managed to retain some of these ancestral functions. Though for our human brethren, the eye has evolved into the Swiss Army knife of senses; equipped with the nervous system and the brain to form the multifaceted human visual perception. This gave them exceptional cognitive functions, awareness and the ability to sense the visible spectrum, depth, and contrast. One such function that proves to be evolutionary beneficial is the ability to distinguish colors. The visible spectrum presents itself on a literal platter so that humans are able to distinguish food source and potential mate for survival.nr They definitely did a lot more with what they see than running aimlessly towards the sun.

  The world ain’t perfect, however, neither was the human visual system. The reliable human eye comes with its minor complications that the brain works tirelessly to correct. One of such biological blunders is the blind spot. It is located in this one point in the retina near the optic nerve, the information bloodbridge between the eye and the brain. The clearing for this bridge is so important that there are no photoreceptive cells here. Any perceived visual information that falls into this spot is virtually invisible. The brain then compensates by working its magic, known as the filling-in phenomenon. It reconstructs this negative spot with the surrounding visual information such as color, brightness, and texture, effectively filling in the blind spot. This is done so well that humans have to take trivial tests to remind themselves blind spots do exist.[4] As there is no addition or subtraction of visual information, you could call this feat a figment of the imagination.

  Speaking of imagination, the human eyesight is a transitionary tool for the brain to make sense of visual stimuli. What they see is an illusion, a representation of the raw visual information. Light enters through the lens of the eyeballs are converged on the retina as an upside down and reversed image. The brain has learned to correct and readjust this image since birth so humans can reliably trust their eyesight while engaging in everyday motor skills. This “image”, however, is often confusingly illustrated as a literal image that falls on the retina (as seen in Fig. 5). This is merely for the proof of concept; again a representation as eyesight is not achieved solely in the retina. The “image” is light or data if you will until It is processed through the visual cortex. It is only then the brain makes sense of this reflected information and tells humans what they are looking at. Their wrinkled thinker dedicates a nice chunk of itself (cerebral cortex) for this task. In short, humans actually see with their brains. Given that seeing is a big part of the human sensorial experience, the brain is the constant state of correction and adjustment. These processes might seem automated at some point, but it is unknowingly taxing for the common primate. How are they able to process everything they see throughout their lifetime? Cue the visual pattern recognition.
<br><br>
  This timeless psychological function serves both as a survival mechanism and a neuronic crutch for the eyes. Its main function is to remind the brain what the eye has perceived in the past, then stores this information as memory and provides context if it happens again. Its purpose is built on past stimulus and experiences to be used as quick references. As future encounters can be precarious, these references are extremely flexible and subjected to change. A lone hunter-gatherer would know better to stay away from a wooly mammoth based on the dangers associated with the massive beast but probably consider taking the shot if he has the aid of a hunting party. In retrospect, It can be roughly described as one of the cognitive processes in which humans learn to understand and adapt. Both the eyes and brains serve this process well and it is fundamental to the essential tools of humanity like reading and language. It paved the groundworks for the enlightened man.

  Welcome child. That was a quick outline of the biological visual perception system. Its basics are the blueprint to our vision and internal functions; its imperfections teaches us about our apparent shortcomings. We will refer to these biological constructs in later arguments.
